 vops.1.d:0 "Vaspier has requested the tiny village of Our Town to establish a cryptography, cryptanalysis, and espionage facility. He probably won't be able to do much with it, but who knows?"

 ### Ideas ###
 VOP_spystate:0 "The Black Site"
 VOP_spystate_desc:0 "This region is directly administrated by VOPS with access to resources of the Hegemony. Information is tightly controlled to ensure nothing slips out, and the ironclad border makes espionage agaisnt it very risky."

 VOP_vopshq:0 "VOPS HQ"
 VOP_vopshq_desc:0 "While VOPS is still heavily active in the fatherland, the headquarters of VOPS has been moved to a massive complex in the land once known as Our Town that sprawls over several kilometers. This complex has been named the Hexagon for its hivelike design. This enables VOPS to conduct extensive local recruitment and training in a facility designed to fit their needs."

 VOP_spystate2:0 "The Black Site"
 VOP_spystate2_desc:0 "VOPS controls everything here. Nothing happens without their knowledge and approval. Even among the Hegemony, entry is an enormously arduous process taking weeks of verification."

 VOP_vopshq2:0 "VOPS HQ"
 VOP_vopshq2_desc:0 "The Hexagon, SIGINT, and other facilities crowd out the old architecture as everything is replaced with superior modern engineering. Skyscapers jut up from land that once only held small cottages. The entire Hegemony is impressed by our skill."

 VOP_total_control_lar:0 "Total Control"
 VOP_total_control_lar_desc:0 "We could be anyone. Every local resistance movement is not only infiltrated by us, but was set up by us as controlled opposition. All social movements are created as limited hangouts to prevent real change. We need not roam the streets in uniform or even in our own skin. In our site, at least, we are omniscient."

 ### Foci ###
 VOP_nothing_much_to_do:0 "Getting Affairs in Order"
 VOP_nothing_much_to_do_desc:0 "Until our plans come to fruition, the Severyanan Black Site shall hide in obscurity. We will construct a massive Hexagon to serve as our base of operations, and mobilize the local population to aid us in our research. Dieter thinks he's got the better deal by ruling all of Stalliongrad, but soon we will show him just how foolhardy he really is."
 VOP_better_encryption:0 "Codes of the Hegemony"
 VOP_better_encryption_desc:0 "Vesalipolis needs a return on their investment. It's time to show them we aren't wasting their money, and by helping the entire Hegemony properly use their code machines, we'll improve security nationwide."
 VOP_better_decryption:0 "The Codebreaker Corps"
 VOP_better_decryption_desc:0 "Codebreaking has always been something we've been rightly proud of, and the Queen's Guard have simultaneously envied and scorned us for it. Every state-owned radio station in the Hegemony must have at least one officer within ten kilometers available for consultation and advice, and as we simply don't have the bugpower for that, it's time to share at least a few of our secrets with our brothers and sisters."
 VOP_massive_recruitment:0 "Massive Recruitment"
 VOP_massive_recruitment_desc:0 "There is no reason to deny loyal inhabitants of our site the right to work for us. Regardless of race, anyone can become a VOPS agent if they pass the tests."
 VOP_garrison_training:0 "Training the Garrisons"
 VOP_garrison_training_desc:0 "The garrisons across the Hegemony are woefully underprepared at finding foreign agents. We will educate them all in how to spot a spy and what to do upon catching them. The most important thing, of course, is to make sure we, not the Queen's Guard, get our hooves on them."
 VOP_even_better_cryptography:0 "VOPS SIGINT and COINTELPRO"
 VOP_even_better_cryptography_desc:0 "Old codes can only get us so far. In our backwater, irrelevant little town, we can begin research into modern code machines and methods of analyzing enemy ciphers, including automated systems. Soon, no one in the world will be able to read our messages, and we will read every one of theirs.\nRemember to transmit in clear or not at all; never partially encrypt!"
 VOP_counterterrorism:0 "Counterterrorism Tactics"
 VOP_counterterrorism_desc:0 "The Queen's Guard is completely wrong about the proper response to terrorism. Widescale oppression will only aggravate the people further. Instead, preemptive disappearances, extensive questioning, and above all, massive intelligence gathering and persuading former terrorists to change sides are the key to success."
 VOP_fund_vops_branches:0 "New VOPS Branches"
 VOP_fund_vops_branches_desc:0 "As excellent as our headquarters are, nothing can replace the value of having lots and lots of agents. To that end, we can use our own economy to set up branches of VOPS in other regions of the Hegemony, and later expand them as we deem fit."
 VOP_complete_urbanization:0 "Complete Urbanization"
 VOP_complete_urbanization_desc:0 "Not a single centimeter of space shall go to waste. Buildings crowd together in efficient, brutalist style. Our factories churn out, not guns or tanks, but booklets, disguises, poisons, and binoculars."
 VOP_the_omniscient_state:0 "The All-Seeing Eye"
 VOP_the_omniscient_state_desc:0 "We could be anyone. Every local resistance movement is not only infiltrated by us, but was set up by us as controlled opposition. All social movements are created as limited hangouts to prevent real change. We do not roam the streets in uniform or even in our own skin, even recruiting extensively from the local population. In our Site, we are omniscient."

 POLITICS_VASPIER_DESC:0 "Initially born in one of the most rural areas of the Changeling hivelands near the Gorak hive, Vaspier has become a key figure of the Changeling administration, even if no one knows it. Sent to gain a higher education by his family after he showed a quick mind from an early age, Vaspier soon became involved with his nation's political struggles. He was one of the changelings who signed on quickly to Chrysalis' bid to unite the hives, and served as her intel gatherer from that point on. From this position, he built the Changeling intelligence agency, VOPS, into a force to be reckoned with. It was, in fact, his hoof that guided the operation of Chrysalis' first attack on Canterlot. That failure damaged his reputation, and since then, he has worked even harder to make himself useful to his Queen. And in this, he has succeeded. The VOPS is the most secretive intelligence agency around, and it is from this that his nickname derives. Now he has been granted an unofficial region to run to his specifications, and only he knows what he will do with it."
