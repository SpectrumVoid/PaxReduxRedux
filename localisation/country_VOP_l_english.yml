 POLITICS_VASPIER_DESC:0 "Initially born in one of the most rural areas of the Changeling hivelands near the Gorak hive, Vaspier has become a key figure of the Changeling administration, even if no one knows it. Sent to gain a higher education by his family after he showed a quick mind from an early age, Vaspier soon became involved with his nation's political struggles. He was one of the changelings who signed on quickly to Chrysalis' bid to unite the hives, and served as her intel gatherer from that point on. From this position, he built the Changeling intelligence agency, VOPS, into a force to be reckoned with. It was, in fact, his hoof that guided the operation of Chrysalis' first attack on Canterlot. That failure damaged his reputation, and since then, he has worked even harder to make himself useful to his Queen. And in this, he has succeeded. The VOPS is the most secretive intelligence agency around, and it is from this that his nickname derives. Now he has been granted a state to run to his specifications, and only he knows what he will do with it."
