However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin.

The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

canterlot.1.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs entered the throne room in Vesalipolis, keeping a strict posture as he bowed before the Queen on the throne. He had been recalled back from Canterlot on short notice, something he had expected. It had been inevitable ever since he had sent that request to the capital. Chrysalis regarded him for a few moments before speaking.\n\n 'I have received your request about forming a Protectorate around Canterlot.' \n\n Jachs slowly nodded, choosing his words carefully. 'Your Majesty, there are still many resistance cells remaining across the Commissariat. I believe that with more autonomy, I would be able to more effectively-' \n\n 'I have already heard your reasoning in the request, Generalmajor.” Chrysalis frowned for a bit at him. “You have done much already in the service of the Hegemony, and succeeded in keeping Canterlot compliant and secure. Your request has already been approved, Protector.' \n\n 'But make no mistake,' she continued, staring Jachs down. 'This is only a temporary measure until the resistance is completely crushed. Canterlot is the crown jewel of Equestria, and it will not do to have others see it as anything other than an integral part of the Hegemony. I expect results from this. Do you understand?' \n\n Jachs nodded. 'Of course, your Majesty."

No matter how much we try to work around things, even with our best estimates, there are too many things to do…' \n\n '...And not enough time to do them,' Jachs finished. 'If we want to have our reforms last here, we need more time to put them in.' \n\n 'But how?' Alcippe put a pair of folders back on Jachs’ desk, sighing. 'It’s not like helping the ponies will buy us more time. If anything, the Queen’s Guard will want the Protectorate gone sooner.'  Letting her head fall into her hooves, the Oberstleutnent rubbed her face. 'What are we going to do, Jachs?' \n\n Silence reigned in the office for a few moments. 'We’ll have to make concessions,' Jachs finally said, breaking the quiet. 'Appease the Empress and the Queen’s Guard, like we’ve always done. Higher Love quotas, catching resistance members… anything that gives us more time.' \n\n 'But Jachs!' Alcippe argued, standing up. 'That’s the exact opposite of what we’re trying to do! It seems like we’re going in circles-' \n\n 'Do we really have a choice?' Jachs’ interruption made Alcippe pause. 'We both know neither of us want this, Alcippe. But I don’t see any other way.' \n\n After a few seconds, the Oberstleutnant sat back down, defeated. 'You’re… right, Jachs. It just seems so wrong, to try and help the ponies while having to put them down at the same time.' \n\n 'I know,' Jachs said somberly. 'So lets make sure the good we do outweighs the bad.''"
